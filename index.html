        <p id="2">In recent years, China has taken the lead in global-warming pollution, producing about 26 percent of all CO2 emissions. The United States comes in second. Despite making up just 4 percent of the world’s population, our nation produces a sobering 13 percent of all global CO2 emissions—nearly as much as the European Union and India (third and fourth place) combined. And America is still number one, by far, in cumulative emissions over the past 150 years. Given this outsize role in accelerating global warming, the United States must step up its financial commitments to bringing about a cleaner, safer, and more equitable future. Our responsibility matters to other countries, and it should matter to us, too.
